                        and make better long-term decisions—especially when it comes to
                        <strong>love, relationships, and personal growth</strong>.

                <p class="about-text">
                    Most relationships don't fail from a lack of love or effort. They fail because we enter them without
                    clarity:
                </p>
                <ul class="about-list about-list-problems">
                    <li>We don't fully understand our own patterns yet</li>
                    <li>We overlook what we're actually selecting for in a partner</li>
                    <li>We struggle to take honest accountability for where we fall short</li>
                    <li>We invest deeply before knowing if we're building on solid ground</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="about-text">
                    And sometimes, despite our best intentions, things don't work out. That's okay.
                    What matters is having the clarity to recognize it before the emotional cost becomes too heavy—and
                    the courage to navigate endings with grace when they come.

            <article class="about-card about-card-approach">
                <h2 class="about-section-title">How I Think About Relationships</h2>
                <p class="about-text">
                    I believe the best time to solve a problem is before it becomes one. These tools are designed
                    to surface the conversations, patterns, and decisions that matter most—<em>before</em> they
                    become breaking points.
                </p>
                <p class="about-text">
                    But I also know that even with the best intentions, some relationships aren't meant to continue.
                    When that happens, the goal isn't to avoid all pain—it's to navigate the ending with honesty,
                    respect, and as little unnecessary hurt as possible. Sometimes the kindest thing we can do is
                    recognize when something isn't working and have the courage to let it go.
                </p>
                <p class="about-text-emphasis">
                    These tools are here to help you find clarity—whether that means building something lasting,
                    or knowing when it's time to step back.

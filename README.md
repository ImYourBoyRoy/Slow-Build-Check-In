## 🌸 What Is This?

This tool helps couples in the **intentional early dating phase** (3+ dates, mutual interest, slow build) navigate gentle check-ins around:

| Topic | What It Covers |
|-------|----------------|
| **Pacing** | What feels too slow? Too fast? When to revisit clarity? |
| **Communication** | How we stay connected, overwhelm patterns, safety |
| **Affection** | What feels best, approach consent, overwhelm signs |
| **Trust** | Group settings, initiative, feeling chosen without pressure |

### ✨ Design Philosophy

- **Warm & Intentional** — Soft colors, gentle language, no clinical terminology
- **Exciting yet Soft** — Blush-lavender palette that energizes and calms
- **Never Overwhelming** — One question at a time, skip freely, smooth transitions
- **Accessible** — Dyslexia-friendly Lexend font, 18px base, WCAG AA contrast

### Adding to Lite vs Full Mode

In `questions.json`, each question has a `tags.included_in_manifests` array:

- `["lite", "full"]` — Appears in both modes
- `["full"]` — Only in Full mode

Also update the `manifests.lite.question_ids` and `manifests.full.question_ids` arrays at the bottom of the file.

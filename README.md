## 🌸 What Is This?

HeartReady is a relationship building toolkit that helps individuals and couples navigate intentional check-ins through multiple phases — with ready-to-use AI reflection prompts:

### 🧭 Phase 0: Pre-Dating Readiness Audit

For assessing emotional readiness **before** starting to date.

| Topic | What It Covers |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| **Readiness** | Emotional state, healing from past relationships |
| **Values** | What matters most in a future partner |
| **Patterns** | Recognizing healthy vs. unhealthy dynamics |
| **Goals** | What you're looking for in dating |

### 💜 Phase 1.5: Intentional Early Dating

For couples in the **slow-build phase** (3+ dates, mutual interest):

| Topic | What It Covers |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| **Pacing** | What feels too slow? Too fast? When to revisit clarity? |
| **Communication** | How we stay connected, overwhelm patterns, safety |
| **Affection** | What feels best, approach consent, overwhelm signs |
| **Trust** | Group settings, initiative, feeling chosen without pressure |

### ✨ Design Philosophy

- **Warm & Intentional** — Soft colors, gentle language, no clinical terminology
- **Exciting yet Soft** — Blush-lavender palette that energizes and calms
- **Never Overwhelming** — One question at a time, skip freely, smooth transitions
- **AI-Ready** — Generate reflection prompts for yourself or as a couple
- **Accessible** — Dyslexia-friendly Lexend font, 18px base, WCAG AA contrast

</details>

### Creating a New Phase

1. Create a new folder in `data/` (e.g., `data/phase_2/`)
2. Copy `TEMPLATE_questions.json` and `TEMPLATE_prompts.json` into it
3. Rename them to `questions.json` and `prompts.json`
4. Edit the content following the schema in `data/SCHEMA.md`
5. Add the new phase to `data/phases.json`

### Adding to Lite vs Full Mode

In `questions.json`, each question has a `tags.included_in_manifests` array:

- `["lite", "full"]` — Appears in both modes
- `["full"]` — Only in Full mode

Also update the `manifests.lite.question_ids` and `manifests.full.question_ids` arrays at the bottom of the file.
